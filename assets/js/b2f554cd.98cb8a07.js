We recently launched our app and shared it on [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/14pdu0m/introducing_crackpipe_your_decentralized), and it has sparked some controversies. We want to take this opportunity to address the feedback and allegations in an official statement.\\n\\nSo let\'s go through the controversies:\\n\\n#### Regarding the name Crackpipe\\n\\nWe want to clarify that the name \\"Crackpipe\\" was initially meant as an inside joke between me and my friend, intended for a tool used by a limited audience. We just got used to it and went on, when deciding to release it to the public. We understand that some find the name inappropriate or uncomfortable, and we sincerely apologize for any distress caused. We are open to renaming the entire application to ensure it aligns better with our community\'s values. Your input is essential to us, so please [join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/NEdNen2dSu) and share your creative suggestions for a new name in the #new-name channel. Soon, we\'ll have a public poll on our blog where you can vote for your favorite name or the existing one.\\n\\n#### Clarification on the term \\"liberal\\"\\n\\nAs non-native English speakers, we made an oversight in using the term \\"liberal,\\" which we intended to mean \\"free\\" or \\"libre.\\" We have already rectified this mistake.\\n\\n#### The use of Pepe the Frog as a profile picture\\n\\nWe apologize for not being aware of the misuse of the Pepe the Frog meme as a symbol of Nazis and white supremacism. That misue is not a thing in europe. Originally, we only knew the frog as a twitch emote/meme and used it without any harmful intentions. In response to your feedback, we have changed the profile picture to a cute penguin, embracing the spirit of open source.\\n\\n#### Addressing concerns about piracy\\n\\nWe want to clarify that our app is not designed for illegal activities, including piracy. When we mention \\"alternatively obtained\\" games, we refer to games acquired from sources other than traditional gaming platforms like Steam. It includes legitimate sources such as archive.org or the Humble Trove. Our aim is to organize your games in one place, provided they are part of the RAWG Database.\\n\\n#### Regarding the origins of the application\\n\\nWe assure you that this application was entirely developed by us, and any similarity to other projects is purely coincidental. We cleaned up our repositories to remove meaningless commits before going public, which may have caused confusion.\\n\\n#### On the marketing strategy\\n\\nWe want to clarify that the controversy surrounding the app was not a planned marketing stunt. As programmers that developed this in spare time, we simply did not anticipate such a strong reaction to a free app.\\n\\n#### Transparancy regarding financial and future plans\\n\\nCurrently, we rely on your [financial support through Kofi](https://ko-fi.com/phalcode). Building an active and engaged user base is our primary focus before considering the addition of any paid features in the future. So for now just enjoy the functionalities.\\n\\n---\\n\\nIn conclusion, we appreciate all the feedback and kind words we have received. If you believe in the app\'s concept but are concerned about the current name, please feel free to suggest a new one and participate in the voting process on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/NEdNen2dSu).\\n\\nWe are determined to improve and grow, and despite the bumpy start, we hope you\'ll enjoy the app and its functionality. We look forward to fostering a vibrant and supportive community around it.\\n\\nFor further updates, you can follow our blog, and new posts will also be shared on our r/crackpipe subreddit and Discord server."},{"id":"/2023/07/01/","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/07/01/","editUrl":"https://github.com/phalcode/crackpipe-docs/tree/master/blog/2023-07-01.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-07-01.md","title":"Introducing Crackpipe \ud83d\ude80 - The Open-Source Alternative to Traditional Game Platforms","description":"Hey Guys,","date":"2023-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 1, 2023","tags":[{"label":"gaming","permalink":"/blog/tags/gaming"},{"label":"Crackpipe","permalink":"/blog/tags/crackpipe"},{"label":"open-source","permalink":"/blog/tags/open-source"},{"label":"decentralized","permalink":"/blog/tags/decentralized"},{"label":"self-hosted","permalink":"/blog/tags/self-hosted"},{"label":"alternative","permalink":"/blog/tags/alternative"},{"label":"cloud-based game platforms","permalink":"/blog/tags/cloud-based-game-platforms"},{"label":"DRM-free games","permalink":"/blog/tags/drm-free-games"},{"label":"file server","permalink":"/blog/tags/file-server"},{"label":"multi-user authentication","permalink":"/blog/tags/multi-user-authentication"},{"label":"metadata","permalink":"/blog/tags/metadata"},{"label":"RAWG API","permalink":"/blog/tags/rawg-api"},{"label":"health monitoring","permalink":"/blog/tags/health-monitoring"},{"label":"API","permalink":"/blog/tags/api"},{"label":"Discord server","permalink":"/blog/tags/discord-server"},{"label":"Reddit forum","permalink":"/blog/tags/reddit-forum"}],"readingTime":1.8,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Alper Alkan","title":"Co-Founder of Phalcode","url":"https://github.com/Alfagun74","imageURL":"https://github.com/Alfagun74.png","key":"alfagun74"},{"name":"Philip Sch\xe4fer","title":"Co-Founder of Phalcode","url":"https://github.com/Yelo420","imageURL":"https://github.com/Yelo420.png","key":"yelo420"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Introducing Crackpipe \ud83d\ude80 - The Open-Source Alternative to Traditional Game Platforms","authors":["alfagun74","yelo420"],"tags":["gaming","Crackpipe","open-source","decentralized","self-hosted","alternative","cloud-based game platforms","DRM-free games","file server","multi-user authentication","metadata","RAWG API","health monitoring","API","Discord server","Reddit forum"]},"prevItem":{"title":"A Bumpy Start - Addressing Feedback and Looking Forward","permalink":"/blog/2023/07/03/"}},"content":"Hey Guys,\\n\\nOur team has been working tirelessly for the past year on creating Crackpipe, the open-source, decentralized, self-hosted, and free alternative to traditional cloud-based game platforms like Steam, Origin, Epic Games, and GoG. We are excited to share that Crackpipe is now available for everyone to use, and we are delighted to open-source it to the community.\\n\\nWith Crackpipe, you can play and track games together with your friends on a shared file server, free from any restrictions that traditional game platforms may impose. We have designed it to work with \\"alternatively obtained\\" games such as DRM-free games, providing a unique solution for those who want a more flexible and open approach to gaming. Think of it like Jellyfin, but for Videogames.\\n\\nCrackpipe offers a self-hosted approach that gives you complete control over your gaming experience. The platform enables you to browse your server\'s game collection, securely download games, launch and play them, and even track your playtimes and progress - regardless of whether the server is offline. Additionally, you can compare stats and play states with other users on the server.\\n\\nOur server features offer automatic indexing of games on the file system into a database, enrichment of games with metadata like tags and genres using RAWG API, multi-user authentication, and configurable logging. We have also implemented health monitoring, full-text search, filters, sorting, pagination, and a fully documented API. The Crackpipe platform is highly configurable to suit your needs.\\n\\nWe are thrilled that you have found us, and we invite you to try Crackpipe today. We would be grateful for any contributions, feedback, bug reports, and feature requests you might have. You can also support us by donating using the \\"Support Us\\" link on our website. If you have any questions or would like to connect with other Crackpipe users, please join our Discord server and Reddit forum - links to which are available in the footer.\\n\\nWe are passionate about creating a gaming experience that is more open, flexible, and enjoyable for everyone. We hope you will join us on this journey and experience the benefits of a truly open-source alternative to traditional game platforms with Crackpipe."}]}')}}]);
