            <description><![CDATA[Hey everyone,]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey everyone,</p><p>today i want to clarify why Crackpipe isn't considered "open-source" by definition.</p><p>You see, Crackpipe is what we like to call <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-available_software" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"source-available"</a> software. This means that our code is open for you to explore and modify, but it doesn't fully meet all the criteria of being considered open-source. I want to take a moment to explain what open-source truly means and why we've taken a slightly different approach.</p><p>According to the widely recognized definitions, <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"open-source"</a> software, as one would think, not only provides access to the source code but also offers certain freedoms to its users. It allows them to use, modify, and distribute the software freely, even for commercial purposes.</p><p>For a self-hosted app like Crackpipe, we believe it's crucual to disclose the source code. We want you, our users, to have full transparency and control over the software you use on your servers. We don't want you to be unaware of what's happening behind the scenes, as is sometimes the case with closed-source applications like Plex, for example.</p><p>Now, you may be wondering why we didn't make Crackpipe fully open-source. The answer lies in our desire to protect our code from unauthorized use and commercial exploitation. While we absolutely encourage you to copy, modify, and share our code for personal use, we want to prevent others from profiting off our hard work by selling our software without our consent.</p><p>It's important to acknowledge that maintaining and developing a software project requires resources. While we admire the open-source community and its valuable contributions, sustaining Crackpipe solely through donations or offering it for free indefinitely is not feasible. For instance, Jellyfin, a popular open-source app developed over a decade, generates only around $13,500 per year (according to their opencollective page). In contrast, Plex, a closed-source alternative, earns a significant $8.5 million annually. Our company's main goal is to keep the core functionality of Crackpipe free, but we also need to explore ways to generate revenue in order to support its future growth and improvement. We are currently considering monetizing additional convenience features for the Client Application in the future, although nothing has been finalized yet.</p><p>We genuinely appreciate your understanding. As a small business with just two members, we strive to provide you with a valuable product but cannot continue to do so as volunteers indefinitely. Sustaining losses in the long term would not be sustainable, especially considering our local tax obligations. We have families and commitments that cannot be neglected, and this project is not our primary job. Therefore, please understand that Crackpipe may not strictly align with the traditional definition of "open-source," and we no longer characterize it as such. Our intention is to be transparent and present our perspective. Your understanding, support, and empathy mean a great deal to us.</p><p>If you have any thoughts or comments on this topic, we'd be more than happy to hear from you. Feel free to share your feedback on our Discord server. We truly value your input and look forward to engaging with you there.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Hey folks,]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey folks,</p><p>We have an important update to share with you all while our poll is in progress. It has come to our attention that a group of individuals has been engaging in harassing, blackmailing, and threatening behavior towards us.</p><p>It began with spam on our Issue Trackers and Discord Server but this situation has escalated to the point where these individuals went so far as to search me up on LinkedIn and threaten to inform my employer with baseless accusations of racism because of trivial reasons like the branch name in our github project being "master". Moreover, we have received reports that these trolls have extended their actions directly to other members of this server, attempting to spread negative narratives and disrupting the community atmosphere.</p><p>To address this issue, we kindly request that you promptly report any encounters with these trolls to both Discord and our dedicated team of moderators. By doing so, we can take appropriate measures to handle the situation and maintain a safe environment for all.</p><p>We would like to emphasize that we are not racist individuals, but rather developers who decided to share our hard work with the community, hoping to bring joy and utility to everyone. Unfortunately, we did not anticipate encountering such creepy behavior when we made the project public. It has made us question whether it was the right decision to open up our work in the first place.</p><p>If you appreciate our efforts and would like to support us and the app, we humbly ask for your financial assistance. Even a small contribution of $5 on <a href="https://ko-fi.com/phalcode" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kofi</a> would go a long way in helping us maintain our motivation and dedication. Alternatively, if monetary support isn't possible, we would be incredibly grateful if you could share kind words about how the Crackpipe app has positively impacted your life in the #chat channel. Your encouragement means the world to us. ðŸ¥°</p><p>In addition, we encourage you to continue reporting any bugs you encounter and submitting feature requests in the respective GitHub trackers. With your valuable input, we can continue improving the app and making it even better.</p><p>Remember, the success of this project relies on your support and engagement. Let's stand together against these trolls and ensure a positive and inclusive community experience. Thank you for your attention and understanding.</p><p>Best regards,</p><p>The Phalcode Team</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Hey everyone,]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey everyone,</p><p>What an eventful day it has been! We recently launched our app and shared it on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/14pdu0m/introducing_crackpipe_your_decentralized" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Reddit post</a>, and it has sparked some controversies. We want to take this opportunity to address the feedback and allegations in an official statement.</p><p>So let's go through the controversies:</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_TVGU" id="regarding-the-name-crackpipe">Regarding the name Crackpipe<a href="#regarding-the-name-crackpipe" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Regarding the name Crackpipe" title="Direct link to Regarding the name Crackpipe">â€‹</a></h4><p>We want to clarify that the name "Crackpipe" was initially meant as an inside joke between me and my friend, intended for a tool used by a limited audience. We just got used to it and went on, when deciding to release it to the public. We understand that some find the name inappropriate or uncomfortable, and we sincerely apologize for any distress caused. We are open to renaming the entire application to ensure it aligns better with our community's values. Your input is essential to us, so please <a href="https://discord.gg/NEdNen2dSu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">join our Discord server</a> and share your creative suggestions for a new name in the #new-name channel. Soon, we'll have a public poll on our blog where you can vote for your favorite name or the existing one.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_TVGU" id="clarification-on-the-term-liberal">Clarification on the term "liberal"<a href="#clarification-on-the-term-liberal" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Clarification on the term &quot;liberal&quot;" title="Direct link to Clarification on the term &quot;liberal&quot;">â€‹</a></h4><p>As non-native English speakers, we made an oversight in using the term "liberal," which we intended to mean "free" or "libre." We have already rectified this mistake.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_TVGU" id="the-use-of-pepe-the-frog-as-a-profile-picture">The use of Pepe the Frog as a profile picture<a href="#the-use-of-pepe-the-frog-as-a-profile-picture" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The use of Pepe the Frog as a profile picture" title="Direct link to The use of Pepe the Frog as a profile picture">â€‹</a></h4><p>We apologize for not being aware of the misuse of the Pepe the Frog meme as a symbol of Nazis and white supremacism. That misue is not a thing in europe. Originally, we only knew the frog as a twitch emote/meme and used it without any harmful intentions. In response to your feedback, we have changed the profile picture to a cute penguin.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_TVGU" id="addressing-concerns-about-piracy">Addressing concerns about piracy<a href="#addressing-concerns-about-piracy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Addressing concerns about piracy" title="Direct link to Addressing concerns about piracy">â€‹</a></h4><p>We want to clarify that our app is not designed for illegal activities, including piracy. When we mention "alternatively obtained" games, we refer to games acquired from sources other than traditional gaming platforms like Steam. It includes legitimate sources such as archive.org or the Humble Trove. Our aim is to organize your games in one place, provided they are part of the RAWG Database.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_TVGU" id="regarding-the-origins-of-the-application">Regarding the origins of the application<a href="#regarding-the-origins-of-the-application" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Regarding the origins of the application" title="Direct link to Regarding the origins of the application">â€‹</a></h4><p>We assure you that this application was entirely developed by us, and any similarity to other projects is purely coincidental. We cleaned up our repositories to remove meaningless commits before going public, which may have caused confusion.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_TVGU" id="on-the-marketing-strategy">On the marketing strategy<a href="#on-the-marketing-strategy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to On the marketing strategy" title="Direct link to On the marketing strategy">â€‹</a></h4><p>We want to clarify that the controversy surrounding the app was not a planned marketing stunt. As programmers that developed this in spare time, we simply did not anticipate such a strong reaction to a free app.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_TVGU" id="transparancy-regarding-financial-and-future-plans">Transparancy regarding financial and future plans<a href="#transparancy-regarding-financial-and-future-plans" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Transparancy regarding financial and future plans" title="Direct link to Transparancy regarding financial and future plans">â€‹</a></h4><p>Currently, we rely on your <a href="https://ko-fi.com/phalcode" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">financial support through Kofi</a>. Building an active and engaged user base is our primary focus before considering the addition of any paid features in the future. So for now just enjoy the functionalities.</p><hr><p>In conclusion, we appreciate all the feedback and kind words we have received. If you believe in the app's concept but are concerned about the current name, please feel free to suggest a new one and participate in the voting process on our <a href="https://discord.gg/NEdNen2dSu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord server</a>.</p><p>We are determined to improve and grow, and despite the bumpy start, we hope you'll enjoy the app and its functionality. We look forward to fostering a vibrant and supportive community around it.</p><p>For further updates, you can follow our blog, and new posts will also be shared on our r/crackpipe subreddit and Discord server.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Hey Guys,]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey Guys,</p><p>Our team has been working tirelessly for the past year on creating Crackpipe, the source-available, self-hosted, and free alternative to traditional cloud-based game platforms like Steam, Origin, Epic Games, and GoG. We are excited to share that Crackpipe is now available for everyone to use, and we are delighted to disclose it to the community.</p><p>With Crackpipe, you can play and track games together with your friends on a shared file server, free from any restrictions that traditional game platforms may impose. We have designed it to work with "alternatively obtained" games such as DRM-free games, providing a unique solution for those who want a more flexible and open approach to gaming. Think of it like Jellyfin, but for Videogames.</p><p>Crackpipe offers a self-hosted approach that gives you complete control over your gaming experience. The platform enables you to browse your server's game collection, securely download games, launch and play them, and even track your playtimes and progress - regardless of whether the server is offline. Additionally, you can compare stats and play states with other users on the server.</p><p>Our server features offer automatic indexing of games on the file system into a database, enrichment of games with metadata like tags and genres using RAWG API, multi-user authentication, and configurable logging. We have also implemented health monitoring, full-text search, filters, sorting, pagination, and a fully documented API. The Crackpipe platform is highly configurable to suit your needs.</p><p>We are thrilled that you have found us, and we invite you to try Crackpipe today. We would be grateful for any contributions, feedback, bug reports, and feature requests you might have. You can also support us by donating using the "Support Us" link on our website. If you have any questions or would like to connect with other Crackpipe users, please join our Discord server and Reddit forum - links to which are available in the footer.</p><p>We are passionate about creating a gaming experience that is more open, flexible, and enjoyable for everyone. We hope you will join us on this journey and experience the benefits of a truly source-available alternative to traditional game platforms with Crackpipe.</p>]]></content:encoded>
